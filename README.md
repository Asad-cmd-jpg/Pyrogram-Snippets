# Pyrogram Snippets

This is an assortment of snippets, ready to use with [Pyrogram]

## About

Every snippet assumes you have set up a `config.ini` and are already logged in with a session called
"my_account" (and thus have a `my_account.session` file present).

All scripts should work as is.
If issues arise, do not hestitate to open an [Issue] or a [Pull Request][PR] if you want to add something. Otherwise I'm available at [Pyrogram's Lounge][Lounge]

## License

I don't care what you do with these snippets,
so I gave this repo the [WTFPL]. Enjoy.
