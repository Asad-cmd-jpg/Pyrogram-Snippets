# Pyrogram Snippets

This is an assortment of snippets, ready to use with [Pyrogram]

[![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.6%20or%20newer-blue)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)

## About

Every snippet assumes you have set up a [`config.ini`][SETUP] and are already logged in with a session called
"my_account" (and thus have a `my_account.session` file present).

All scripts should work as is.
If issues arise, do not hestitate to open an [Issue] or a [Pull Request][PR] if you want to add something.
Otherwise I'm available at [Pyrogram's Lounge][Lounge] (Ask for "Colin").

## Snippets

The snippets are in the [Snippets](Snippets#snippets) directory.

## License

I don't care what you do with these snippets,
so I gave this repo the [WTFPL]. Enjoy.
